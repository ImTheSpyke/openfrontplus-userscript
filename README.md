# What is OpenFrontPlus
 Its a simple overlay that improve parts of the visual game to make it more ergonomic and intuitive.
 It is mainly aimed for casters on the Esport scene, but can be also used as a player.

 The overlay doesn't give you any unfair advantage ingame.

### Features:

- ✅ See impact zone of Atomb Bomb & Hydrogen bombs and who sent it
- ⏳
- ⏳ Scoreboard in pie chart for map %, gold, and troops (Coming soon...)
